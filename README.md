Euratom Open-Source Project Template
====================================

This repository contains a skeleton project to help developers establish a code repository under the Euratom organisation.

Creating a New Project
----------------------

For developers creating a new project, please use the template project in this repository as the basis for your new code repository.

If a repository is being created for an existing code, please merge the contents of this repository into your codebase. 

This repository contains a number of files, some of these are recommended (but optional) and some are mandatory. The mandatory files are necessary to either comply with licencing requirements or to support the automatic creation of community software catalogues.

You will find the following files and folders in the repository:

    code_templates/ - a set of example code templates that include the required copyright header.
    AUTHORS.txt - a list of contributers to the project (OPTIONAL)
    CHANGELOG.txt - a user friendly log of the changes to the project (OPTIONAL)
    CITE.txt - instructions how to cite your code in publications (OPTIONAL)
    CONTRIBUTING.txt - instructions for developers contributing to the project (OPTIONAL)
    LICENCE.txt - the EUPL v1.1 licence text
    LOGO.png - the project logo
    README.md - the file containing this text, to be replaced by the developer.

A number of these files will need to be updated with information relavant to your project, for example the copyright header.

Licence and Copyright
---------------------

Unless otherwise agreed, Euratom codes must be licenced under the EUPL v1.1 public license. The LICENSE.txt file in this repository contains the EUPL v1.1 license text as required by the license. All code files must include a suitable copyright statement, examples of which can be found in the code-templates folder.
